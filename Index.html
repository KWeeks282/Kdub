		   <p> Welcome to my winter weather analysis of 2023-2024. I will present my current analysis of this winter's winter.
               First, I would like to discuss the weather pattern. This year, winter weather will be dictated by a strong El Nino transiting into a  moderate El Nino later in the winter. 
			   This El Nino has the potential to be a great winter for snow lovers in the south, while some in the North may disappointed by the lack of snow due to more warm air blocking cold air from coming in the Northern tier of the United States of America. 
			   With Negative N.A.O. A negative N.A.O. means a weak polar circle, which means a greater chance of a cold spell causing a massive cooldown in the United States. 
			 First this winter trending toward a Moderate -Strong El Nino.
			  Last winter was a Weak La Nina with positive NAO which made Northwest wetter and Northern Midwest wetter meanwhile the South was dry and below average Normal El Nino would dry and warmern on the Northwest while the Northeast is wetter andd cooler.However this winter will be interesting 
			  .I want to share my Possible Scenario for the Winter of 2023-2024 this Winter so. Most of my information is from websites or YouTube channels that have done term analyses, while others are combinations of both.Now, these early analyses may not be accurate in addition.

	 <h1> Temperature and Precipation </h1>
	 <p> Typical ElNino temperature will be above average in the West and northern Mountian, all to the Great Lakes Regionâ€”below average precip.
	Meanwhile, the Southern States have cooler temperatures and precipitation. Of course, like La Nina, not everyone. El Nino is the same or will be excellent in the south and warm in the north.
	Many underlying factors play a massive part in the weather pattern, and they will react. Especially with this winter, this El Nino weird behavior has made it unpredictable.
	However, we have some models and videos that give a close enough analysis of what this will be like.

	The Northern West Coast will be below average in precipitation and have above temperatures, which will significantly impact later on in the year as we get into summer and the drought kick, 
	which could lead to massive fires that could burn more acres of land. So states such as Washington, Wyoming State, Montana and Idaho .
	   <img src= "North WesternMAP.png" width = "400" height = "400">
	
	On the Southern West Coast, the weather trend is slightly above to slightly below average. The temperature will warm and above average precip,& this will also mean increased snow chances in the Rookie Mountian & Serria Mountains. 
	This will include states like Nevada, Colorado, New Mexico,& California. 

 The South Part I ere Storm and Rain Lower Texas, Albama Gerogia,and Florida, Lousina will be increased chancing of severe weather. 
 Winter Precipitation is unlikely because the latitude of these areas rarely gets cold enough for that precipitation. 
 It will be Cooler in addition the are likely chance of bad frost in some these southern area.

  Missisipissi ,Gerogia, Alamba ,South Carolina Tennesee Arakness will be a winter battle zone plus snowfall enhancement. While this area still gets Severe Storms, 
 the location is far north enough latitude-wise to receive Wintery Precipitation. Especially in El Nino Years, where the Cooler Air is more southward, 
 and the south gets a southern sliding winter storm because the winter storms that form in the south form & slide across the south before heading up north to the mid-Atlantic and areas like New York City.

 Mid-Atlantic & East Coast This Northeastern central
 Will be dealing with significant northeastern. This has a chance to bring significant snowfall to this area but also has an opportunity to get substantial rain storms. 
 The snow path depends on how the cold air is set up. If the cold air is more inland, then it will be a rainy event in the Bay Area, like New York City or Boston, 
 but if the cold air is also around the coastal area as well, then massive snowfall is likely due to happen . In additon ocean effects snow will possible ,which is similar to lake effect snow.
 Ocean Effect snow happen  huge snowfall total are likely in are then usually get small to moderate Such as state Like Virgina,New Jersey,Lower New Tork.

<h1> Weather Forecast </h1>
<p> Upper Midwest, which includes the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota, and 
Parts of the Dokaota weather trends are above average in temperature, & the temperature will be 3-4 above agree addition. 
The Upper Midwest will trend moderately below average in snowfall. 
It will be a Cold Outbreak but not as severe.

Meanwhile, the lower midwest, which includes the lower half of Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, and Parts of Northwest Pennsylvania, will be Above average, slightly in temperature and precipitation will be moderate to slightly below average. The weather in this area will be tricky this year to predict.
Some predict that winter will be a wild card, and you can have everything from heavy rain, snow, ice storms, or sleet above or below precipitation. While others believe That the beginning of winter would seem mild and dry, the winter will transition wetter as the season progresses, especially during Late January, February, and early March. 
When it comes to Lake Effect Snow, there will be less snowfall; however, temperature rebounds could spark Lake Effect Snow Squalls to happen due to rapid temperature.

     <img  src= " ELNinoModoki2324.png "300" width" height = "400" >  
  
  
  
  Northern Midwest and Northern Great Plains northWest will be significantly above. 
Meanwhile, the Northern Northeast, Lower Great Lake, and Southern Great Plain will be slightly above average to near normal, and the Atlantic to most southern states will be above average regarding temperature, increasing the snow chances for many areas.
  Overall, I expect the winter to be similar to 2009-2010 but a bit colder in the north. 
  El Nino after January will revert to moderate El Nino and then later is likely to become Natural. 
  In addition, this El Nino might be Modoki El Nino since the warm water in the Ocean is moving eastward, which is indicative of Modoki and also that they are short-living strong El Nino.
